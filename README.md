# Sales Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This Python project conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset using data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the sales data through visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Installation

To run the project locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:  

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
  
## Data  

The dataset used in this analysis is stored in 'Sales_dataset1.xlsx'. It contains information about sales transactions, including customer demographics, product details, purchase types, payment methods, and sales amounts.
